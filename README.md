# Final_Project
A Repository where my work and progress on my final project will be stored.

My code will model the trajectory of a ping pong ball along with a basketball. With will output graphs that show the trajectory of the ping pong ball with a set backspin and drag. It will then give four graphs of a basketballs trajectory with different backspin. the trajectories will be found using Euler's method for the velocity and trapezoidal rule for the position. 

Installing my code can be done by cloning the file to you desktop using Github. Once cloned and downloaded it can be opened using Jupyter Notebook, this must be install if that has not been done already. When done installing  and downloading my code, it is necessary to also install

The code was written by William Willmon with assistance from Dr. Danielle McDermott.
